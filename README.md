# NLP_Spam_Classifier

•	The SMS Spam Collection is a set of SMS tagged messages that have been collected for SMS Spam research. 

•It contains one set of SMS messages in English of 5,574 messages, tagged according being ham (legitimate) or spam.

•	The files contain one message per line. Each line is composed by two columns: Column 2 contains the label (ham or spam) and Column 1 contains the raw text.

•	I first performed some data preprocessing to clean the data.

•	Then, I built a Multinomial Naive Bayes model and trained it on the training set and evaluated the model on test data
